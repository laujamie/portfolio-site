Hello World! My name is Jamie and welcome to my blog. I am currently a student studying Statistics
and Computational Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. I have had previous experiences
working as a software developer intern at Georgian Partners, CI Investments, AGF Management,
and Exact Imaging.

This is my first blog post ever, as I wanted to write about things that I have been learning
in my journey as a software developer. In addition, I may also blog about some other random
things that I may be interested in at a specific time. This blog will not be particularly
active, as I will mostly only write when I have inspiration.

Thanks for reading and have a great day!
