            I'm a software engineer with experience in full-stack web development. I have worked with Go, Python, TypeScript,
            React, and Kubernetes. Previously, I was working on building a remote monitoring solution for autonomous trucks at
            Embark, using Go, gRPC, Python, React, and TypeScript. I also developed a pub/sub system using Go, ROS, and C++
            to allow our operators and engineers to view truck sensor data. Before that, I did multiple internships in FinTech
            to help visualize data for their clients and teams. If you have any potential opportunities, I would be happy to
            connect with you!!
