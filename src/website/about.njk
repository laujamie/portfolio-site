            My name is Jamie Lau and I am currently in my Undergrad for
            Statistics and Computational Mathematics (Double Major) at the
            University of Waterloo. I have had previous software development
            internships at Georgian Partners, CI Investments, AGF Management,
            and Exact Imaging. When I'm not spending time in school or working
            on new projects, I enjoy running as well as playing basketball.
